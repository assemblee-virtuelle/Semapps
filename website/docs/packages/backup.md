title: Backup
---

This service allows you to backup the triples in a given dataset, as well as the uploaded files.

## Features

- Rsync Fuseki datasets backups with a remote server
- Rsync uploaded files with a remote server
- Setup a cron to automatically launch the rsync operation

## Dependencies

- [FusekiAdminService](fuseki-admin.md)

## Install

```bash
$ npm install @semapps/backup --save
```

You will need to have `rsync`, `sshpass` and `openssh` installed on your server.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install rsync sshpass openssh
```

You will also need to add the remote server domain as a known host, otherwise sshpass may fail:

```bash
ssh-keyscan REMOTE_SERVER_DOMAIN_NAME >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

## Usage

```js
const { BackupService } = require('@semapps/backup');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mixins: [BackupService],
  settings: {
    localServer: {
      fusekiBackupsPath: '/absolute/path/to/fuseki/backups',
      uploadsPath: path.resolve(__dirname, '../uploads')
    },
    // Rsync
    remoteServer: {
      user: 'user',
      password: 'password',
      host: 'remote.server.com',
      path: '/my-backups'
    },
    // Required only if you want to do automatic backups
    cronJob: {
      time: '0 0 4 * * *', // Every night at 4am
      timeZone: 'Europe/Paris'
    }
  }
};
```
